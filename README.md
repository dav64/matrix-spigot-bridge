# MatrixSpigotBridge

MatrixSpigotBridge is a Spigot plugin that uses [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org 'An instant messaging protocol') to let interact with the players without being connected on Minecraft.

This will let players the ability to chat with people on your Matrix server as well as having people on the Matrix server be able to chat with people on the Minecraft server

The plugin could be useful for example in the situation of someone not being at their computer and wanting to talk to in-game players.

If you like placeholders, we do too!
[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245 'Plugin PlaceholderAPI by clip') is supported so if you have it, you can add fancy placeholders in all plugin's messages :)
(for example to display in which server / faction / ... the player sending the message in)
